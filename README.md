# HTML-Passphrase-Hasher
just that: generate typeable passwords from plain language phrases (per XKCD's "Correct Horse Battery Stapple"). Just slice the base64 SHA256 (any one way function will do, SHA256 may have not been the best choice) of UTF8 text, and the the first handful of characters should make for anadequetly complex typeable password. So instead of storing actual passwords in keepass or LastPass or whathaveyou, there can just be hints and pw length stored instead. Not as convenient though and may prove entirely unnecessary... 

In fact it might be found to be a dumb idea once someone with a cryptography background gives it a look, but got me an A in a java course and have I received complements on (at least the idea of) it so far from a professional java dev and a CISSP, so I am running with it.
